# SUMMARY
In this project I chose to analysis the births in the U.S. in order to get an understanding of what cultural or social factors may influence pregnancy. 
# OVERVIEW
To tackle this project, I searched around for some data about earths population and birth rates. I came accross a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/temporary-us-births) courtesy of kaggle user danbraswell. 

To begin I first imported the data to a jupyter notebook in order to do some data exploration/cleaning. In the notebook I took a quick look at the data to understand how the set is structured by using pandas. I also used matplotlib to create some very basic visualizations in the notebook.

After exploring the data, I imported the set into Tableau to begin creating and structuring a beautiful dashboard to help consume and visualize the data in a more digestible way.
